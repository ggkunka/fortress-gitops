# Complete Platform Outage - Disaster Recovery Runbook

**Incident Type**: System-Wide Outage  
**Severity**: 1 (Critical)  
**Response Time**: 15 minutes  
**Last Updated**: 2024-01-01  

## Overview

This runbook covers the response to a complete platform outage where all or most services are unavailable to users. This is typically caused by infrastructure failures, network issues, or cascading service failures.

## Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)

### 1. Incident Declaration
- [ ] Declare Severity 1 incident
- [ ] Page on-call incident commander
- [ ] Create incident channel: `#incident-platform-outage-YYYYMMDD`
- [ ] Update status page to "Major Outage"

### 2. Initial Assessment
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Verify external service dependencies
- [ ] Confirm user reports match monitoring data
- [ ] Estimate affected user percentage

### 3. Team Assembly
- [ ] Page technical lead
- [ ] Page infrastructure engineer
- [ ] Page database administrator
- [ ] Notify communications lead

## Investigation Phase (15-30 minutes)

### 4. System Health Check
```bash
# Check container orchestration
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -v Running

# Check load balancers
curl -I https://api.mcpsecurity.com/health
curl -I https://app.mcpsecurity.com/health

# Check database connectivity
psql -h db-primary -c "SELECT 1;"
psql -h db-replica -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check Redis
redis-cli -h redis-primary ping
redis-cli -h redis-replica ping
```

### 5. Infrastructure Verification
- [ ] Cloud provider status page
- [ ] DNS resolution working
- [ ] CDN status
- [ ] External API dependencies
- [ ] SSL certificate validity

### 6. Application Layer Check
```bash
# Check application logs
kubectl logs -l app=api-server --tail=100
kubectl logs -l app=web-server --tail=100
kubectl logs -l app=worker --tail=100

# Check application metrics
curl http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=up
```

## Common Failure Scenarios

### Scenario A: Infrastructure Failure

**Symptoms**: All services down, infrastructure unreachable

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Check cloud provider status
2. [ ] Verify network connectivity
3. [ ] Check load balancer health
4. [ ] Validate DNS configuration
5. [ ] Switch to backup infrastructure if available

```bash
# Switch traffic to backup region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
  --change-batch file://failover-to-backup.json

# Verify backup infrastructure
kubectl config use-context backup-cluster
kubectl get nodes
```

### Scenario B: Database Cluster Failure

**Symptoms**: Applications unable to connect to database

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Check primary database status
2. [ ] Verify replica availability
3. [ ] Check connection pools
4. [ ] Review recent database changes
5. [ ] Consider promoting replica to primary

```bash
# Check database cluster status
patroni list

# Promote replica if primary is down
patroni switchover --master db-primary --candidate db-replica-1

# Update application configuration
kubectl patch configmap db-config -p '{"data":{"host":"db-replica-1"}}'
```

### Scenario C: Application Deployment Issue

**Symptoms**: Services failing to start after recent deployment

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Identify recent deployments
2. [ ] Check application logs for errors
3. [ ] Verify configuration changes
4. [ ] Roll back to last known good version
5. [ ] Validate rollback success

```bash
# Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/api-server
kubectl rollout history deployment/web-server

# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-server
kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-server

# Monitor rollback progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-server
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-server
```

### Scenario D: Resource Exhaustion

**Symptoms**: High CPU/memory usage, pods being killed

**Actions**:
1. [ ] Check resource usage metrics
2. [ ] Identify resource-consuming pods
3. [ ] Scale up critical services
4. [ ] Kill non-essential processes
5. [ ] Add more nodes if necessary

```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces

# Scale critical services
kubectl scale deployment api-server --replicas=10
kubectl scale deployment web-server --replicas=5

# Add more nodes (if using cluster autoscaler)
kubectl patch deployment cluster-autoscaler -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"cluster-autoscaler","args":["--nodes=1:20:worker-nodes"]}]}}}}'
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Service Restoration Priority
1. **Database layer** (highest priority)
2. **Authentication service**
3. **Core API services**
4. **Web application**
5. **Background workers**
6. **Monitoring/alerting**

### 7. Database Recovery
```bash
# If primary database is down
# 1. Assess data integrity
sudo -u postgres pg_waldump /var/lib/postgresql/12/main/pg_wal/

# 2. Start database in recovery mode
sudo systemctl start postgresql@12-main

# 3. Verify database connectivity
psql -h localhost -c "SELECT current_timestamp;"

# 4. Check replication status
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```

### 8. Service Recovery
```bash
# Start services in order
kubectl apply -f database/
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=database --timeout=300s

kubectl apply -f auth-service/
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=auth-service --timeout=300s

kubectl apply -f api-service/
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=api-service --timeout=300s

kubectl apply -f web-service/
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l app=web-service --timeout=300s
```

### 9. Health Verification
```bash
# Test core functionality
curl -f https://api.mcpsecurity.com/health
curl -f https://api.mcpsecurity.com/auth/health
curl -f https://app.mcpsecurity.com/

# Run smoke tests
cd tests/smoke
python run_smoke_tests.py --environment production

# Check error rates
curl "http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/query?query=rate(http_requests_total{status=~'5..'}[5m])"
```
