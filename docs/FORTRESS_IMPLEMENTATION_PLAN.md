# üè∞ FORTRESS CNAPP - PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Build complete production CNAPP platform equivalent to Orca Security

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE (Weeks 1-2)
**Deploy Production Data Stack**
- Kafka cluster (3 brokers) for event streaming
- Elasticsearch cluster (3 nodes) for security analytics  
- MinIO cluster for S3-compatible object storage
- Neo4j for asset relationships and attack paths
- Redis cluster for distributed caching

### PHASE 2: FORTRESS SECURITY AGENTS (Weeks 3-4)
**Deploy Distributed Security Agents on K8s Clusters**

**Fortress Agent Components:**
1. **eBPF Runtime Monitor**: Syscall monitoring, process tracking, network analysis
2. **Network Scanner (nmap)**: Port scanning, service discovery, network topology mapping  
3. **Vulnerability Scanner (Nessus)**: Comprehensive vulnerability assessment, config auditing
4. **Container Analyzer (Anchore)**: Deep container image analysis, policy enforcement
5. **DAST Engine**: Dynamic application security testing, API testing, web app scanning
6. **Compliance Scanner**: CIS benchmarks, PCI-DSS, SOC2 configuration checks

**Agent Architecture:**
- **DaemonSet Deployment**: One agent per cluster node
- **Secure Communications**: mTLS to Fortress central platform
- **Data Collection**: Real-time streaming + batch reporting
- **Local Processing**: Edge analytics to reduce network overhead
- **Policy Engine**: Configurable scan schedules and compliance rules

### PHASE 3: CORE SERVICES (Weeks 5-7)
**Build 6 Production Services**

1. **Agent Management Service**: Deploy, configure, and monitor distributed agents
2. **Ingestion Service**: Cloud APIs + Agent data aggregation and normalization
3. **Enrichment Engine**: MITRE ATT&CK, CVE databases, threat intel feeds
4. **Correlation Engine**: Attack path reconstruction, multi-stage detection, agent data fusion
5. **Risk Assessment**: ML-powered scoring, CVSS + business context + runtime behavior
6. **Response Orchestrator**: SOAR integration, automated remediation, agent-based response

### PHASE 4: ENHANCED CNAPP CAPABILITIES (Weeks 8-10)
**Implement 4 CNAPP Pillars with Agent Integration**

1. **CSPM**: Multi-cloud config assessment + Agent-based cluster configuration auditing
2. **CWPP**: Runtime security (eBPF agents) + container scanning (Anchore agents) + DAST
3. **CIEM**: IAM analysis + Agent-based RBAC monitoring + privilege escalation detection
4. **DSPM**: Data classification + Agent-based data flow monitoring + encryption validation

**Agent-Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Real-time Threat Detection**: eBPF monitoring for zero-day attacks
- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment**: Nessus + Anchore + custom scanners
- **Dynamic Security Testing**: Live application testing with DAST agents
- **Network Security Analysis**: Real-time network topology and threat mapping
- **Compliance Automation**: Continuous compliance monitoring across all clusters

### PHASE 5: ORCA-STYLE FRONTEND (Weeks 11-12)
**Professional Security Operations Center with Agent Management**
- Left sidebar navigation with asset categories + agent status
- Unified dashboard with severity scoring + real-time agent metrics
- Asset inventory with drill-down capabilities + agent deployment status
- Alert management with risk prioritization + agent-generated alerts
- Real-time updates via WebSocket + agent telemetry
- **Agent Management Console**: Deploy, configure, monitor distributed agents
- **Live Security Dashboard**: Real-time eBPF, DAST, and scan results

### PHASE 5: INTEGRATIONS (Weeks 11-12)
**External System Integration**
- Cloud Providers: AWS/Azure/GCP native APIs
- SIEM: Splunk HEC, Elasticsearch, QRadar
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins security gates
- SOAR: Phantom, Demisto workflow automation
