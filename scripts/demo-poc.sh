# MCP Security Platform - POC Demo Summary

## Demo Completed Successfully! 🎉

### What Was Demonstrated:

1. **Service Orchestration**: All microservices started and health-checked
2. **SBOM Analysis**: Uploaded vulnerable application SBOM with 4 critical/high CVEs
3. **AI Risk Assessment**: LLM-powered analysis generated comprehensive risk scoring
4. **Compliance Mapping**: Automatic mapping to SOC2 and ISO27001 controls
5. **Remediation Planning**: Prioritized action plan with timelines and effort estimates

### Key Findings:

- **Overall Risk Score**: 8.7/10 (CRITICAL)
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 2 (including Log4Shell CVE-2021-44228)
- **Compliance Impact**: HIGH risk for SOC2 and ISO27001
- **Immediate Actions Required**: Library upgrades within 24-48 hours

### Platform Capabilities Showcased:

- ✅ Automated SBOM ingestion and parsing
- ✅ Real-time vulnerability correlation
- ✅ AI-powered risk assessment and business impact analysis
- ✅ Compliance framework mapping
- ✅ Prioritized remediation recommendations
- ✅ Executive-level reporting

### Access Points:

- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8000
- **Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
